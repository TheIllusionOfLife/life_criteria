## Purpose

Digital Life explores whether autonomous digital organisms can satisfy all seven biological criteria for life through functional analogy rather than simplified proxies.

## Target Users

- ALife researchers
- Computational biology and complex systems researchers
- Developers building reproducible simulation experiments

## Key Features

- Multi-organism continuous 2D simulation
- Criterion-ablation-friendly simulation configuration
- Metabolism modes (toy and graph-based)
- Experiment summary output for quantitative analysis
- Python bindings for experimentation workflows

## Objectives

- Produce publishable experimental evidence for criterion-level functional behavior
- Enable reproducible simulation runs and controlled ablations
- Maintain a fast iteration loop for architecture and experiment design

## Non-Goals (Current Phase)

- Production-grade end-user UI
- Strong ALife claims (the project is framed as weak ALife)
- Stable long-term API guarantees during the research phase
