"""Phenotype clustering and niche analysis.

Analyzes evolution experiment data to identify emergent phenotypic clusters
and spatial niche associations among populations at the final timestep.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/analyze_phenotype.py > experiments/phenotype_analysis.json

Output: JSON analysis to stdout + progress to stderr.

Implementation lives in ``analyses/phenotype/``; this file is a thin dispatcher.
